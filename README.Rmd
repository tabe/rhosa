# rhosa: Higher-Order Spectral Analysis in R

<!-- badges: start -->
[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/rhosa)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rhosa)
[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/tabe/rhosa/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tabe/rhosa/actions)
<!-- badges: end -->

This package aims to provide functions to estimate higher-order spectra or
polyspectra of multivariate time series, such as bispectrum and
bicoherence [@brillinger_investigation_1998].
They are useful for e.g. detecting nonlinear interaction between
stationary time series driven by periodic signals [@abe_detecting_2024].

## Installation

You can install the released version of rhosa from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org)
with:

``` r
install.packages("rhosa")
```

Alternatively, the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/)
with [remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=remotes):

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("tabe/rhosa")
```
